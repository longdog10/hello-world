# hello-world
This is my first experience with GitHub.
I have a history with development in C++, Java, HTML, Javascript, and CSS.
I am looking to learn C# and Python. I am also interested in helping out on GitHub.
I am currently an IT Support Admin at a market research company in Wisconsin.
I have a wife, son, two cats and a dog.
